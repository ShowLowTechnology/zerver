{"body":"Zerver is a lightweight Node.js-based webserver that lets you seamlessly make server API calls as if they were a library on the client. The goal is to provide a developer-focused toolset and remove all the boilerplate involved in serving a webapp.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install -g zerver\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Basic Usage\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a directory of this structure.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwebsite-dir/index.html\r\nwebsite-dir/zerver/MyAPI.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything in `website-dir` will be served as static content except for code in `zerver/` which will run on the server.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// in website-dir/zerver/MyAPI.js\r\nexports.logStuff = function (data, num) {\r\n    console.log(data.stuff); // 'hi from client'\r\n    console.log(num); // 5\r\n    callback('hi from server', { more: 'data' });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- in website-dir/index.html -->\r\n<script src=\"zerver/MyAPI.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\n    MyAPI.logStuff({ stuff: 'hi from client' }, 5, function (str, data) {\r\n        console.log(str); // \"hi from server\"\r\n        console.log(data.more); // \"data\"\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# run the server\r\nzerver website-dir\r\n# go to http://localhost:8888/ to view the magic\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What just happened?\r\n\r\n`MyAPI.logStuff` automatically serializes the arguments of the function call and makes an AJAX request to the server. The server runs the function in `website-dir/zerver/MyAPI.js` and responds to the client in a similar way.\r\n\r\nNote: any server code in a subdirectory of `website-dir/zerver` will not be available for import on the client allowing for libraries of private server functionality.\r\n\r\n### Require syntax\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- in website-dir/index.html -->\r\n<script src=\"/zerver/require.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\n    var MyAPI = require('MyAPI');\r\n    MyAPI.logStuff('hi from client', function (str) {\r\n        console.log(str); // \"hi from server\"\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug mode\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nzerver -d website-dir\r\n```\r\n\r\nZerver will automatically reload the server modules when any server-side code is edited. This is allows for rapid development and testing of server-side code.\r\n\r\n### Auto-refresh mode\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nzerver -dr website-dir\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny webpage being viewed that has a Zerver script on it (`website-dir/index.html`) will automatically refresh when any of its code is edited. You can edit code and immediately see feedback on how it effects your running webapp.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
